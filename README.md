# devenv-spawner

Automated provisioning of development user environments on dev-vm.

**Version:** see [VERSION](VERSION) | [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)

## Overview

devenv-spawner creates and manages development environments for multiple users on a shared Ubuntu VM. It replicates the core development tooling (Node.js, Docker, Claude Code, tmux, git) into isolated user home directories, so each person gets a fully functional dev setup without interfering with others.

This repository was renamed from `dev-spawner` to `devenv-spawner` on 2026-05-13 as part of the `devenv-stack` consolidation. The canonical stack record lives in `~/src/home-infra/docs/DEVENV_STACK.md`; the legacy `~/src/dev-spawner` path remains as a temporary compatibility symlink during the transition.

After provisioning, the script automatically verifies the environment (12 bash checks) and uses Claude Code CLI to diagnose any failures.

Built for a family home lab where the main dev-vm (Ubuntu 22.04, 16GB RAM, 2 vCPU) serves as the shared development machine.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Ubuntu 22.04+ VM with sudo access
- Existing working dev environment (the "reference" user)

### Usage
```bash
# Create a new dev user
sudo ./scripts/spawn-user.sh <username> --git-name "Full Name" --git-email "email@example.com"

# With optional modules
sudo ./scripts/spawn-user.sh <username> --git-name "Name" --git-email "email" --with-ollama --copy-admin-credentials

# Update existing user's dotfiles (creates .bak backups)
sudo ./scripts/spawn-user.sh <username> --update-templates

# Remove a user
sudo ./scripts/despawn-user.sh <username>
```

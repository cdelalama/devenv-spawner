Every change must be documented. If you are unsure about a rule, ask the user before proceeding.

<!-- DOCKIT-TEMPLATE:START doc-update-rules -->
### Documentation Update Rules
- Update docs/llm/HANDOFF.md every time you make a change.
- Append an entry to docs/llm/HISTORY.md in every session.
- HISTORY format defaults to `any`: either `- YYYY-MM-DD - <LLM_NAME> - ...` or `YYYY-MM-DD - <LLM_NAME> - ...` is accepted. Set top-level `history_format: dash` or `history_format: no-dash` in `.dockit-config.yml` when a project wants strict enforcement.
- Projects with a phase-based roadmap can opt into semantic phase drift checks with `.dockit-config.yml` `orientation_drift.enabled: true`; this fails when entry docs describe a completed roadmap phase as "next".
- Put long-form rationale in docs/llm/DECISIONS.md and link to it from HANDOFF.
- Prefer ASCII-only in docs/llm/* to avoid Windows encoding issues.
<!-- DOCKIT-TEMPLATE:END doc-update-rules -->

<!-- DOCKIT-TEMPLATE:START doc-sync-rules -->
### Documentation Sync Rules
- Keep this file's "Current Focus" section synchronized with docs/llm/HANDOFF.md "Current Status".
- Keep docs/STRUCTURE.md synchronized with the actual repository file tree.
- Keep docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md synchronized with architectural reality.
- Version markers (`<!-- doc-version: X.Y.Z -->`) in documentation files are managed by `scripts/bump-version.sh`. See `docs/version-sync-manifest.yml` for the full list of tracked files.
<!-- DOCKIT-TEMPLATE:END doc-sync-rules -->

<!-- DOCKIT-TEMPLATE:START commit-policy -->
### Commit Message Policy
- Every response that includes code or documentation changes must end with suggested commit information:
  - **Title:** under 72 characters
  - **Description:** under 200 characters, focused on user impact and why the change matters
- Format:
  `
  ## Commit Info
  **Title:** <concise title>
  **Description:** <short explanation of what changed and why>
  `
<!-- DOCKIT-TEMPLATE:END commit-policy -->

<!-- DOCKIT-TEMPLATE:START version-management -->
### Version Management
- Every commit that changes code/config files MUST include a version bump. The pre-commit hook enforces this.
- For version bumps, run `scripts/bump-version.sh <new_version>`; do not edit version strings manually.
- The bump script reads `docs/version-sync-manifest.yml` to update all tracked files atomically.
- Supported manifest marker types are `version-file`, `changelog`, `html-comment`, `json-version`, `yaml-info-version`, and `package-lock-version`.
- Validate sync with `scripts/check-version-sync.sh` (also available as pre-commit hook).
- Do not bump versions without consulting docs/VERSIONING_RULES.md for impact level (patch/minor/major).
- Do NOT batch multiple code commits without versioning. No exceptions.
<!-- DOCKIT-TEMPLATE:END version-management -->

<!-- DOCKIT-TEMPLATE:START env-policy -->
### Environment Files (If Applicable)
- Do not edit generated .env.example files directly.
- Never change or remove existing credentials in .env or equivalent secret stores.
- If a new variable is needed, document it in the relevant README and ask the user to add it manually.

## LLM-to-LLM Communication
When handing off to another LLM:
1. Update docs/llm/HANDOFF.md with the current state and next steps.
2. Append an entry to docs/llm/HISTORY.md following the required format.
3. Ensure the snapshot in this file matches the latest status.
<!-- DOCKIT-TEMPLATE:END llm-communication -->

<!-- DOCKIT-TEMPLATE:START trace-protocol -->
## Trace Protocol

Every substantive assistant turn in a DocKit-governed session must begin with
a compact `Trace` header, then continue with the normal explanation in prose.
This includes execution, audit, design opinions, recommendations,
brainstorming, clarifying questions, status reports, and go/no-go calls.

A turn is substantive if the operator might need to find it when returning to
a multi-window workflow: it contains a decision, opinion, recommendation,
status, audit, action, or clarifying question. Non-substantive turns such as a
pure acknowledgement under 50 characters do not require Trace, but emitting
Trace is always safe. The header is for orientation; it does not replace the
message.

Required chat header fields:
- `Role`: `executor`, `auditor`, or `advisor`
- `Sent`: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS <local-tz> (HH:MM:SS UTC)`. The order and
  precision are mandatory: local time first, UTC second in parentheses, seconds
  included on both sides.
- `Subject`: current task, question, recommendation, or commit hash/title being implemented or audited
- `Resulting state`: what this message leaves true after it is sent
- `Repo state`: local branch vs origin and worktree status verified now
- `Validation`: checks run and result
- `Next gate`: who/what should act next

Time verification:
- Verify `Sent` before writing it; do not infer or mentally convert the time.
- If shell access is available, run both:
  ```sh
  date -u '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S UTC'
  TZ=Europe/Madrid date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z'
  ```
- Replace `Europe/Madrid` with `trace_protocol.local_timezone` from
  `.dockit-config.yml` when the project sets one.
- If the agent cannot verify the clock, write:
  `Sent: unverified client time YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS <claimed-tz>`.
- Prefer generating the close-out scaffold immediately before sending it:
  ```sh
  scripts/dockit-trace-status.sh --role executor --subject "<commit/task>" \
    --validation "<checks>" --next "<next gate>"
  ```
  This prints current HEAD, local/upstream state, worktree cleanliness, version,
  and verified local/UTC time from git/date instead of relying on memory.

Recommended `Resulting state` shape:

```text
Resulting state: HEAD=<hash|unchanged (hash)>; version=<version|none>; gate=<opened|cleared|blocked|superseded|next-slice>; <short note>
```

Examples:

```text
Resulting state: HEAD=01f90bb; version=4.9.1; gate=cleared; supersedes audit of d6fc816
Resulting state: HEAD=unchanged (01f90bb); version=none; gate=cleared; ready for next slice
Resulting state: HEAD=unchanged (d6fc816); version=none; gate=blocked; requires executor patch v4.9.1
```

Use clear prose after the header. Explain what changed, why it matters, what
was verified, and what risk remains.

When reading an older Trace block, do not treat its `Repo state` as current
without checking the tree again. If the `Sent` time is more than a few minutes
old, or another LLM/operator may have acted since it was written, verify
`git status`, `git log -1`, and the current clock before acting on the report.

When `trace_protocol.enabled: true` is set in `.dockit-config.yml`, the durable
half is enforced by `scripts/dockit-validate-session.sh --check trace-protocol`:
- `docs/llm/HANDOFF.md` must contain a `## Trace Anchor` section.
- HANDOFF Trace Anchor commit times may use `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC` or
  `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC`.
- A committed HANDOFF Trace Anchor is a durable repo-side anchor, not a
  guaranteed live HEAD pointer. Prefer neutral labels such as `Subject:` or
  `Trace target:`. Projects can set
  `trace_protocol.reject_current_anchor_label: true` to fail anchors labelled
  `Current target:` or `Current audit target:`.
- `docs/llm/HISTORY.md` entries dated on or after `trace_protocol.since` that
  reference backtick-quoted commit hashes must end with an inline footer:
  `Trace: role=executor|auditor|advisor; commits=hash1,hash2; state=...; validation=...; next=...`

Projects can set the local timezone used in `Sent` with:

```yaml
trace_protocol:
  local_timezone: Europe/Madrid
```

Projects that do not use Trace-oriented LLM windows can disable the chat-side
convention with:

```yaml
trace_protocol:
  enabled: false
```

## Do Not Touch Zones
Use the Do Not Touch section in docs/llm/HANDOFF.md to flag any files or areas that must remain unchanged without explicit approval from the user.
<!-- DOCKIT-TEMPLATE:END do-not-touch -->

<!-- DOCKIT-TEMPLATE:START independent-review-policy -->
### Independent Review Policy

For consequential source candidates that require an independent model review,
the operator-wide default is:

1. Prefer Fable, exact model `claude-fable-5-1`, with high effort.
2. If direct quota evidence shows that exact Fable is unavailable because its
   quota is exhausted, Opus may complete the same review gate using exact model
   `claude-opus-5[1m]`, with high effort. Record the quota evidence, effective
   model, effort, command, candidate revision/tree, and validation packet in
   `docs/llm/REVIEWS.md` when it exists, otherwise in the audited revision's
   HISTORY entry. When durable Trace is enabled, keep non-commit object IDs such
   as tree hashes as plain text in HISTORY and HANDOFF Trace Anchors:
   backtick-quoted hashes are reserved for commit provenance and must resolve as
   commits. Never remove backticks from a commit to bypass validation; classify
   a cross-repository commit with the Trace `external=repo@hash` field instead.
3. Never substitute Sonnet, Haiku, an ambiguous alias, or an unrecorded model.
   If neither allowed exact model is available, freeze the candidate and audit
   packet. Continue only work already authorized that does not depend on the
   missing verdict.

The auditor is independent and read-only: it reads primary files and evidence,
does not edit the candidate, and returns evidence-backed findings. The executor
must verify each finding, reconcile disagreements with the same auditor session
where practical, and preserve explicit unresolved disagreement for the
operator. A review verdict does not authorize build, deployment, runtime,
secrets, infrastructure, lifecycle, or acceptance changes.

This synchronized section is the fleet default, not permission to weaken an
existing project contract. A stricter project-local accepted rule wins until
the operator explicitly supersedes it. Projects that intentionally own a
different policy may exclude `independent-review-policy` in
`.dockit-config.yml`; the exception and rationale must remain visible locally.
